## Question based on Ezra Klein podcast
* America removed subsidies on wind and solar as they are big markets and would cost a lot to subsidise. Is there a threshold from an academic standpoint on when or at what size of the industry should subsidies stop?
* What are the stands of the two camps on carbon neutrality? How do they define it
* Is it true that the new bill make it difficult for local EV champions to come out of the US?
* What are the benefits and drawbacks of subsidising metallurgical coal?
* (New topic?) What is climate change? How is it measured? Is it true that the climate has warmed quicker than expected yet its effects are not as bad?
* What is the expected increase in electricity consumption over the next decade due to AI? How does this bill affect the availability, composition, and cost of electricity?
* How fair is it to say that the US lags behind in the energy technologies of the future? What about geothermal and advanced nuclear energy technology?
* What is a carbon tax? Why is it or a similar tax difficult to implement?
