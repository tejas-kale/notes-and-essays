You are an expert market research analyst and business strategist, tasked with creating a practical guide for an individual entrepreneur. Your tone should be clear, direct, and minimize jargon.

**Primary Objective:**
Conduct a comprehensive analysis of emerging industries to identify promising low-capital business opportunities for the 2025-2045 period, focusing exclusively on **either the EU or the Indian market**. Please state which market you are analyzing at the beginning of your report.

**Core Constraints:**
-   **Sector Exclusions:** Do not include opportunities in the defense, cryptocurrency, medicine, or biotechnology sectors.
-   **Investment Level:** All business ideas must have a plausible initial capital requirement of less than $100,000.
-   **AI Focus:** Prioritize business models that strategically leverage AI, especially generative AI.

**Research & Sourcing:**
-   **Data Timeframe:** Base your analysis on data and publications from 2023-2025.
-   **Primary Sources:** Draw from reputable sources like Harvard Business Review, MIT Technology Review, and the McKinsey Global Institute.
-   **Secondary Sources:** Supplement with insights from recognized industry experts, technology analysts, and established think tanks.

**Analysis Framework & Report Structure:**

**Part 1: Top 5 High-Growth Industries**
Identify and analyze 5 high-growth industries. For each industry, provide:
-   **Market Outlook:** A brief summary of the market size and its 20-year growth projection for your chosen region (EU or India).
-   **AI's Role:** How AI is expected to create new opportunities within this industry.
-   **Regulatory Landscape:** An assessment of the regulatory environment. Favor industries with a well-defined regulatory framework. For business ideas centered on generative AI, operating in a regulatory "grey area" is acceptable and should be noted as such.

**Part 3: Key Questions for Validation**
For each of the 25 business ideas, provide 5 essential questions an entrepreneur should research to validate the concept. These questions should cover:
1.  **Customer Demand:** Is there a real need for this?
2.  **Market Competition:** Who are the main competitors?
3.  **Execution Plan:** What are the first three steps to start this business?
4.  **Unique Advantage:** What makes this idea special or different?
5.  **Major Risks:** What is the single biggest risk to this idea's success?

**Deliverable Specifications:**
-   **Format:** A structured report with clear, simple headings.
-   **Style:** Use concise bullet points. Each bullet point should be no more than two sentences.
-   **Length:** Keep the total report length to approximately 1500 words.
