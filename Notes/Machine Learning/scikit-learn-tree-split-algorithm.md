I'll analyze how scikit-learn decides the first split of a decision tree by examining the code and tracing through the splitting logic.Let me search for more specific information about the splitting algorithms:Based on my analysis of the scikit-learn source code, I can explain how scikit-learn decides the first split (and all subsequent splits) of a decision tree.

## The Split Selection Process
Scikit-learn **does use a brute-force search** across features to find the best split, but with some important optimizations and constraints. Here's how it works:

### 1. Splitter Selection
From `_classes.py`, we can see that scikit-learn uses different splitter classes based on the `splitter` parameter:

```python
DENSE_SPLITTERS = {"best": _splitter.BestSplitter, "random": _splitter.RandomSplitter}
SPARSE_SPLITTERS = {
    "best": _splitter.BestSparseSplitter,
    "random": _splitter.RandomSparseSplitter,
}
```

The default is `splitter="best"`, which uses `BestSplitter` for dense data.

### 2. Feature Subset Selection
The key insight from the documentation in `_classes.py` is that the algorithm doesn't always search **all** features:

```python
# From the max_features parameter documentation:
# When max_features < n_features, the algorithm will
# select max_features at random at each split before finding the best
# split among them.
```

This is controlled by the `max_features` parameter:
- If `max_features=None` (default for DecisionTreeClassifier/Regressor), it searches all features
- If `max_features` is set to a smaller value, it randomly selects that many features to consider

### 3. The Core Algorithm: `node_split_best`
The actual split finding is implemented in the Cython function `node_split_best` in `_splitter.pyx`. Based on the search results, this function:

1. **Randomly permutes features** at each split (even with `splitter="best"`)
2. **Iterates through the selected features** (up to `max_features`)
3. **For each feature**:
   - Sorts the samples by that feature's values
   - Tries different threshold values between consecutive unique feature values
   - Evaluates the impurity improvement for each potential split
4. **Selects the split with the best impurity improvement**

### 4. Threshold Selection Within Features
For each feature, the algorithm performs a brute-force search over all possible threshold values. From the code structure, it:
- Sorts samples by the current feature's values
- Considers split points between consecutive unique values
- Evaluates each potential threshold using the chosen criterion (Gini, entropy, etc.)

### 5. Special Cases
- **ExtraTreeClassifier/Regressor**: Uses `splitter="random"` by default, which selects split thresholds randomly rather than exhaustively searching
- **Missing values**: The algorithm has special handling for missing values, trying both directions (left/right) for missing value assignment

## Code References
The key components are:
- **`BaseDecisionTree._fit()`** in `_classes.py` (lines 332-470): Sets up the splitter and tree builder
- **`BestSplitter.node_split()`** in `_splitter.pyx`: Calls `node_split_best`
- **`node_split_best()`** function in `_splitter.pyx`: The core brute-force search algorithm

## Summary
Yes, scikit-learn uses a brute-force approach, but it's **constrained brute-force**:
- It searches exhaustively within the selected feature subset (determined by `max_features`)
- Within each feature, it exhaustively tries all possible split thresholds
- The "brute-force" nature is what makes decision trees interpretable but also computationally expensive for high-dimensional data

This is why the `max_features` parameter is so important for controlling both performance and model variance - it limits the search space while introducing beneficial randomness.
